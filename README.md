## Analyzing customer transactions

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze purchase data from customer receipts to identify frequently occurring product combinations and explore their relationships. The main focus is on using associative rule algorithms to build recommendations, optimize assortment and improve customer experience.

## Functionality

- Identifying popular product combinations.
- Analyzing relationships between products of different categories.
- Build parallel coordinate graphs to visualize associative rules.
- Apply results for cross-selling and personalized offers.

## Technologies used

- **Python**: Main Programming Language.
- **Libraries**: pandas, mlxtend, matplotlib, plotly.
- **Algorithms**: Associative rules (Apriori).

## Visualization

The project uses parallel coordinate graphs to visualize the relationships between items. They visualize the frequency and complexity of product combinations.

## Results and application

- Frequently occurring combinations: bread, milk, eggs, sausage.
- Optimization of assortment and marketing strategies.
